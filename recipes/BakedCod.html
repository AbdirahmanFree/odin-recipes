            This baked cod recipe is simple, fast, and delicious.
             The fish is baked in butter, then topped with lemon juice, white wine,
              and buttery crackers for the perfect ten dinner.
               This dish is a favorite of ours from a local restaurant.
                Serve with rice pilaf and sautéed spinach with garlic. Yummy!

            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>½ sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
            <li>1 pound thick-cut cod loin</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 °F (200 °C).</li>
            <li>Place 2 TBSP butter in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on high until melted (about 30 seconds). Stir in crushed buttery round crackers.</li>
            <li>Place the remaining 2 TBSP butter in a 7x11″ baking dish; melt it in the oven for 1-3 minutes. Remove the dish and coat both sides of the cod loins in the melted butter.</li>

            <li>Remove the cod, then top it with lemon juice, dry white wine, and the buttery cracker mixture. Return to the oven and bake about 10 more minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and green onion. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
