        <p>Chef John's handkerchief lasagna is made with paper-thin homemade pasta sheets,
             folded over a delicate ricotta filling and a light amount of pasta sauce.
              These filled "handkerchiefs" are then layered
               to create one of the best versions of lasagna ever.
